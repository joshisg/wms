poc for warehouse management system
I am trying to create the generic poc for store grains storage business.

I initiated this proof of concept (PoC) with the aim of establishing my own grain storage warehouse. To enhance operational efficiency, I decided to develop an automated billing system. As a first step, I conducted meetings with individuals currently engaged in this business to gather fundamental requirements. This included understanding how they maintain their accounts and the various methods they use to charge farmers. Based on this information, I translated these requirements into technical specifications and designed the necessary endpoints for the system.

Given my background as a backend developer, I prioritized completing the REST API components before addressing the UI design. This approach allows me to leverage my strengths and ensure a solid foundation for the backend, before transitioning to the user interface development.


Tech stack : core java 1.7, Spring Boot, Spring Data Jpa, in memory database H2, MAVEN, GIT and Github
