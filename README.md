poc for warehouse management system
I am trying to create the generic poc for store grains storage business.

I started this poc because initially I am planning to start my own grane storage warehouse
so I thought why not we will try automated bill calculation system. So I have decided to meet the peoples who are alreday
doing this business So I can take basic requirement gathering how they will maintain thier account. how they will charge farmers so such basic 
requirement I have calculated converted into technical and design some end points. I have to design UI also but I totally a backend developer So I decided to 
complete REST API part latter will deal with UI.

Tech stack : core java 1.7, Spring Boot, Spring Data Jpa, in memory database H2, MAVEN, GIT and Github
